# ece160-hw02
For this assignment, you will need to fork this respotiory (see the upper-right corner of this page).
Once you have your own fork, clone it like you would with any other repository. Edit the methods in 
`hw02.c` to return the correct values, and then commit and push your changes to your fork.

Details about the implementations of the functions in `hw02.c` are in the comments.
